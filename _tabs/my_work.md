## ðŸ’» vibeOS Legacy | Designer & Developer

vibeOS Legacy (then called vibeOS) was my introduction into programming with vibeOS and hard coded UI design. It allowed me to experiment with what I would want to see in an Operating Enviornment and allowed me to practice skills with the toolset I had available to me.

## ðŸ’» vibeOS | Designer & Developer

vibeOS is the reincarnation of vibeOS Legacy, designed to be a complete code rewrite meant to correct the shortcomings of its predecesor and allow myself and the rest of the vibeOS Development Team to explore possibilities and make it better and better.

## C# Learning Project: 8 Ball

Being an avid viewer of Barnacules on YouTube, I had watched his series on getting started in Coding in C#. I really enjoyed and decided to create a variation on the project that is more interactive and uses actual responses from an 8 Ball. I really liked how it turned out and am personally proud of it, even if it is pretty simple.
